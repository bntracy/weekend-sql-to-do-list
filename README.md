# SQL To-Do List

## Description

A basic to-do list. Items can be added, deleted, or marked complete. Completed items display a timestamp marking the time of completion. There is also a link to a second interface that includes the additional feature of confirmation dialogues when deleting items. Both interfaces access the same database.

### Prerequisites

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

## Installation

1. Create a database named `weekend-to-do-app`
2. The queries in the `database.sql` file are set up to create the necessary table and populate some starter data, if desired. The project is built on [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/download/), so you will need to make sure to have that installed. We recommend using Postico to run those queries as that was used to create the queries
3. Open up your editor of choice and run an `npm install`
4. Run `npm run start` in your terminal
5. Navigate to `http://localhost:5001` in your browser
